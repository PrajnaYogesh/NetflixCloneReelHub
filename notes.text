useContext:
If you have fetched the data in App.jsx and want to send the data fetched directly to other components without using props then we use this

steps:
1) first import {useContext,createContext} from 'react'

2)create a context 
const CollectionContext = createContext();

2)create a custom hook to use the context you created
const useCollection = () => useContext(CollectionContext);
